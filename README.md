A place where I track the projects/labs I'd like to work on


### Micro UI Framework

Create a micro UI framework using philosophies from Vue and React

### Javascript REPL

`babel-node` works, but not without a few flaws. For instance, you can't globally run it with certain presets/plugins, they have to be in the directory it's opened within.

This project would allow for running the REPL anywhere, globally configuring it, and perhaps having an integrated buffer that lets you interactively add plugins/presets while you're running the REPL. And perhaps publish the work to gist.github.com, or a code playground.
